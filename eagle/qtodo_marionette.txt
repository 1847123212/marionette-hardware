Questions and TODO list for the marionette board

Q: Is the input clock frequency on the USB3320 chosen correctly by the REFSEL[2:0] pins.  010 selects 12MHz.  Can PB14 generate 12MHz?

Q: There are 15 available ADC signal lines but I am only using 12 (+ one on the MBUS ID SCHEME.  What is happening with the remaining three lines?

T: Set the "SwapDP/DM" register on the USB3320

T:  Check the reference and the analog supply pinning to the DAC124

T:  Must tie VREF+ on the STM to VDD because the two voltages must be within 300mV (double diode connected internally).
