Pick package for XTAL, pick package for TCXO that matches.  Use 26MHz crystal.  Make TCXO NP option with np resistor on the Xin line.
  Consider Abracon ASTX-H11-26.000MHZ-T (3.2mm x 2.5mm package, 2.5ppm, $2.72/hundred)  
  Consider Connor-Winfield D32G-026.0M (3.2mm x 2.5mm package, 0.5ppm, $7.00/hundred)
-DONE  added TCXO with passives

Change input to be a 'T' pin block that selects VCC between Vext, Vcoax.
Consolidate to 1 fuse.  -DONE
Consider scaling down the fuse rating so that it explodes before the FR014f5JZ. -DONE FR014f5JZ is rated for 8A DC, fuse will blow in 2ms above 8A.
Make sure the testpad on the SYNC pin has a through hole.
-DONE
Make proper kelvin connection between kelvin resistor and kelvin network.
-MAYBE, do calculation to see if this is worthwhile 
Label the current output of the supplies.
-DONE
Make sure the transistor in the Zeta has sufficient voltage rating.
-DONE, Replaced 30V PFET with the IRFR9024 which is rated for 55V, 11A.  This is because the dock_test_jig will probably have a 24V supply because there is only one 18V supply available and thirty 24V supply wall warts.
Check that the LDOs are low noise. -DONE replaced ADP125s with MIC5305 fixed output regulators.
Check that the LDOs have at least 60dB PSRR.  DONE  85dB PSRR
Compare LDOs to the MIC5305  DONE

Check if the TPS40200 can be disabled by grounding the SS pin. DONE- yes grounding the SS pin shuts off the switching supply
Make a note as to what each power supply is for (i.e. 1.8V is for ULPI) -DONE
Put a box and label around the external power connector.  -DONE
Move power header to the header page.  -DONE
Put STM power connections on the STM PORTS.  -WHAT DOES THIS mEAN?
Change sheet name to PORTS.  -DONE
Change power and boot to just POWER.  -DONE
Make a test pad with via device with 10mil drill hole and 20mil drill hole -DONE with 0.6mm drill
Change ECOD ANALOG to just ANALOG -DONE

Mark the cap attributes according to actual electrical requirements.  Collapse the bom manually.  DONE
Reassess the VCAP cap values.  DONE
Make VBUS symbol.  DONE
Remove the testpoints on the ULPI interface.  DONE
Change the SO bootstraps on the ULPI to select 26MHz if dave says OK.  DONE
Kill the BOOT0 jumper J23.  DONE
CAN transceiver SHDN should have a pullup? pulldown? to be normally off.  DONE, SHDN signal is "shutdown on high", therefore put a 10k pullup in, I did.
Check RS value on the CAN transceiver MAX3051.  DONE, RS is pulled low for high speed operation.  slope of signal controlled by RS resistor value.
Kill TP75 which is RS on the CAN.  DONE
Change the SWD jumper back to vertical keyed type. DONE 
Talk to Dave about how to program the ULPI registers (to enable DP/DM swap).  -DONE  chibios does not have solid infrastructure for swapping DP/DM and so leave in default state until future rev.
Kill the EEPROM module.  KILLED_IT
Put a series resistor in the Xout of the 26MHz crystal for gain control.  DONE, the gain control is only needed on the TCXO I presume and so I presume that the gain control can be done with the NP resistor on the XIN line.
Kill SD testpoints on parallel lines.  DONE
Investigate pullups on the SDIO. See if the CMD line needs a pullup.  DONE, put a 50k pullup resistor on the CMD line and all unused data lines so that they don't float if a card is not inserted.  See http://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/SDSpec.pdf section 3-3.  Apparently the resistor value should be 50kish.  The marionette_v1.0 value was 4.7k.  
Model transfer function in LTspice and graph as a sanity check.
Relabel PF2 to CAN_SHDN or something.  DONE
Connect the TCXO to the STM with an R to Cpar to Cseries to change a 1400mV square wave into a 200mV sine wave.  DONE  
TPs not necessary on serial buses that go to external headers.
MBUS (I2C) will need real 4.7k, but these resistors should be on the interface board.   
Call "Analog Connector ID", "Serial Connector ID", etc. instead of "Analog Bus ID", etc.  DONE
Check that the Anti-Aliasing filter is correct.
Change the supply for the MBUS switches to be V3.3D  DONE
Run the DAC VA and VREFIN off a dedicated 3.3V analog supply.  Read the power suppply section of the DAC datasheet.
Make the boxes around the Connector ID switches all the same size.  Crunchify the box sizes.
Make sure that the STM can have an external reference
Partition the power bus to facillitate debugging (put 10k resistors to the EN signals on the power supplies).
Make 100mil jumper symbol as a placeholder in the BOM.
Place TVS diodes
Find out if the COMP pin on the TPS40200 can be used in compensation loop.
